Notes:

There is no UI to the system, just a simple command
/rob, /mug or /pickpocket
when you perform the command, you can specify a percent of cash to take:
/mug 20 will take 20% of your targets' total cash, 35 will do 35% and so on (not exceeding 15k) (also not exceeding 40%)
if you are dead, the pickpocketing will not occur
if you are far away, the pickpocketing will not occur
